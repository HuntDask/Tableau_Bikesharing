# Tableau_Bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis
Using the visualization software Tableau, we examine citibike trends and perform analysis using Tableaus various data visualization analysis tools. We look at Citibike and its demographics from who rides by gender, what times are the highest and lowest in rides, and the bes times for bikes to be delievered adn repaired. We also are able to look at where the bikes are taken the most and where they end up using the story mode in Tableau public and the data/graphs we collected.
